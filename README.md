This project is a simple Rust application. Currently, it demonstrates basic number comparison operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust programming language: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Building the Project

To build the project, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:

```sh
cargo build
```

### Running the Application

After a successful build, you can run the application using:

```sh
cargo run
```

This will execute the `main` function in [src/main.rs](src/main.rs), which currently prints the results of comparing two predefined numbers.
